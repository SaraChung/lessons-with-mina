This was the first time I have used HTML5/CSS3 to make anything -

It was inspired by my Bitmaker Labs instructor, Mina Mikhail, who spiced up his lectures (unintentionally)
with tons of quotable quotes. We were tasked with a Photogur assignment, which was a simple clone of Imgur,
and combined with the fact that I was probably the only one in class at that point who didnt know how to 
use HTML5/CSS3, I took this as a learning opportunity.
